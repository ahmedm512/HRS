1- Mysql Or Sqllite is applicable in our project?
Ans: Sqllite (Till Now) reasons; The main reasons is the portability ability where the db is stored in the file disk
'file.db' and doesnt require any servers to be launched before fetching/updating the database, faster to access and connecting
with small projects 'data' ofcourse less secure but we dont care because it is operated locally
